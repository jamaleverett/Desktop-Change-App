# Desktop-Change-App! 
Program that changes the desktop background on MacOS automatically using Unsplash images and user-generated search terms.

This is a small program I wrote that uses the Unsplash API to change the desktop background on MacOS. While changing the background image, the program saves a list of the photo's URL for future reference and it will also save the given search terms, so that the program can run from the terminal without any other input from the user.
