# Desktop-Change-App! 

This is a small program I wrote that uses <a href="https://unsplash.com/developers">Unsplash API</a> to change the desktop background on MacOS. While changing the background image, the program saves a list of the photo's URL for future reference and it will also save the given search terms, so that the program can run from the terminal without any other input from the user :)
